										<span>ABOUT FIND YOUR PATH</span> <br><br>
										Find Your Path is a user-friendly web map intended for use by mobile devices. It allows users to browse parks and trails around San Marcos, Texas. Weather information provides current conditions and outlook for users to plan their use of the parks and trails. Users can take advantage of the available location services in the web map to search for available parks and trails closest to them. What sets Find Your Path apart from other trail web maps is the Editor Widget. Combined with location services, this feature gives users the ability to create, delete, and edit features that are on the trail. Features include but are not limited to drainage issues, trail erosion, litter, fallen trees, graffiti, washouts, or anything else that might be considered obstruction or degradation of a trail. The goal is to provide an experience for users to enjoy area trails while allowing them to update conditions in real time to improve the overall experience for other trail users.
